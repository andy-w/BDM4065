# BDM4065_MonitorSwitcher
System Tray Control App for Philips BMD4065 monitor to switch input source.

I have several systems connected to my monitor using a kvm switch for a keyboard, mose and second monitor. The systems are connected to the Philips by different inputs, e.g. DP, mini DP. The KVM switching is detected by device arrival event for the mouse which switches the monitor to the appropriate input.

Currently a lot of this is hard-coded, hopefully will develop or provide some useful ideas for others.
